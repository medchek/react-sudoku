# React Sudoku

A Suduku game with some of the features that I have always thought lacking whenever I played it. The game uses an algorithm (which can be found in my [other repo](https://github.com/medchek/sudoku-generator-algorithm)) to pre-generate a fully filled and valid sudoku grid beforehand, making therefore every played game 100% solvable. The UI was written with React using typescript and designed using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html).
